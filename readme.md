part A(1 and 2).
* Initialized 2 arrays as da for die A and db for die B
* Created an empty list for appending the possible combinations
* Created a nested loop where the outer loops represent die A and inner loop represents die B
* Appended the possible combinations
* The length of that combinations list was obtained to find the total combinations.
* The combinations list was iterated to print the possible combinations

and so on until we get 36 combinations

part A (3).
* Created an empty dictionary as "sums"
* Within a nested loop, the possible sums were obtained
* Let the sum be the key and its number of of occurences be the value in the dictionary "sum"
* Accordingly a condition was created. 
* The dictionary was iterated to find the probability of the occurences of possible sums
probability= count of occurences/total combinations

part B output: 
* Steps similar to the previous question was repeated but with die A = [1,2,3,4] and die B = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8]
Couldn't satisfy the condition that probabilities should remain the same as the previous question
